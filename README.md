# RoboFriendsApp-v2
## ErrorBoundaryInReact 

This is the RoboFriendsApp(v2) with Error Boundary(in React) for better user experience. Though, now the Error is visible on the webpage because we're running it on development mode. But when it'd be on production, only the message that we want to render in front of users will be visible on the webpage. It is an extra safety with Error Boundary during production.

### To run this project:
* clone this repo
* npm install
* npm start

Then, to see the app, just comment the "if statement" from *CardList.js* file and the app will be visible:
